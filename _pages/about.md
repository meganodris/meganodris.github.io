I am a [Schmidt Science Fellow](https://schmidtsciencefellows.org/) at the Geneva Center for Emerging Viral Diseases. My research focuses on the development and application of analytical methods to support immunological surveillance of infectious diseases. I am interested in the challenges posed for robust epidemiological analysis of emerging and re-emerging pathogens and the role that serological data can play in addressing these. Much of my work has focused on arboviruses such as dengue and chikungunya, as well as emerging viruses including Mpox and SARS-CoV-2.
